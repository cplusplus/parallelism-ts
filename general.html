    <h1>Scope</h1>
      <p>This Technical Specification describes requirements for implementations of an
      interface that computer programs written in the C++ programming language may
      use to invoke algorithms with parallel execution. The algorithms described by
      this Technical Specification are realizable across a broad class of
      computer architectures.</p>
      
      <p>This Technical Specification is non-normative. Some of the functionality
      described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization
      in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part of any C++ standard.
      Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be
      standardized, and other functionality may be standardized in a substantially
      changed form.</p>
      
      <p>The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing
      practice for parallelism in the C++ standard algorithms library. It gives
      advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>

    <p>Since the the extensions described in this Technical Specification are
    experimental and not part of the C++ Standard Library, they should not be
    declared directly within namespace <code>std</code>. Unless otherwise specified, all
    components described in this Technical Specification are declared in namespace

    Once standardized, the components described by this Technical Specification are expected to be promoted to namespace <code>std</code>.

    Standard Library are assumed to be qualified with <code>std::</code>.</p>

    <p>Extensions that are expected to eventually be added to an existing header
